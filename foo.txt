IMPORTANT TO APPRECIATE JEHOVAH’S RULERSHIP(6 min.)
People everywhere long for righteous rulership, government that can really solve their problems
The problems  of  finding  employment,  obtaining  ample food,  safeguarding  our  environment,  eliminating  dis-
ease, and overcoming barriers that divide mankind require solutions beyond what men offer (Ec 1:15)
Answer lies with our Creator, Jehovah God, and his Kingdom (w85 11/15 3-5)
We need to grasp the extent and nature of Jehovah’s rulership
His laws control movements of all heavenly bodies as well as natural cycles that make life on earth possible
Some of his laws that operate for our good do so without thought on our part
As man’s Creator, he knows what we really need in order to enjoy full health, long life, happiness
His commands regarding our worship and our relations with fellow humans require us to choose, to show
whether we want to obey (lp98-105)
God’s commands are not oppressive but are for our good (Isa 48:17)
They enrich our life now and help us gain future life (1Ti 4:8)
People of all nations are being given opportunity now to show whether they really want God’s rulership in all
matters of life; do they want to live under the government of God?
He is the Creator and the almighty God, and his purpose to express his sovereignty through the Kingdom, a
government in hands of his Son, Jesus Christ, cannot be thwarted
Our continued enjoyment of life is at stake because it is an unalterable truth that life is dependent on God
(Re 4:11)
Will we personally seek God’s Kingdom, giving it the place it deserves in our lives?
IN SERMON ON MOUNT, JESUS SHOWED HOW TO SEEK THE KINGDOM(30 min.)
(Invite all to open Bible and follow as texts are read)
Jesus taught disciples to pray for Kingdom, asking for it to “come” with destructive force against wicked sys-
tem (Mt 6:10;w78 8/15 5-6;w89 8/15 12-13)
Warned that not all who profess faith will gain the Kingdom (Mt 7:21-23;w90 10/1 23-4;w78 12/1 14-15)
We need to examine our own position, be sure we really are doing the will of the Father
To succeed in getting life in the heavenly Kingdom with Christ or life as its subjects on earth, we must culti-
vate the qualities that God approves
God views favorably those who are conscious of spiritual need, mild-tempered, hungry for righteousness, mer-
ciful, pure in heart, peaceable (Mt 5:3-9;w78 2/1 27-9;w78 2/15 8-10;w78 3/1 4-5)
Happiness results from cultivating these qualities
To get into the Kingdom, one must have deep regard for God’s law—all of it (Mt 5:17-20;w78 4/1 29-31;w86
10/15 8)
As long as the Law given by God through Moses was in effect, Jewish followers were to practice it and ad-
vocate obedience to it
We must not be like Adam; not willfully disobey in any matter
Neither must we be like Pharisees, who had own brand of righteousness (w90 10/1 12, 19 ̊14, 15)
Not merely obey the letter  of  the Law;  must get the spirit of  it and  act in  harmony with  it (Mt 5:21,  22;
w90 10/1 13 ̊12, 13;w78 4/15 21-2;w89 7/15 24-5)
Besides doing what is right, we need to learn to love what is right (Mt 5:27, 28;w90 10/1 13 ̊14;w78 5/15 28)
Bible urges us to safeguard the heart
Jehovah wants only willing subjects, those who truly prefer his ways
Important to learn to imitate God in showing love (Mt 5:43-48;w90 10/1 13 ̊12, 14, ̊18, 19;w78 7/1 5-6)
This  kind  of  love  is  not  stifled  by  pride  when  others  are  unappreciative  but  seeks  the  lasting  welfare  of
others, even those who act like enemies
We must be striving to be at peace with brothers, genuinely loving them, in order to serve God acceptably
(Mt 5:23, 24;w78 5/1 29-30;wt147 ̊7)
(Brief review of Matthew chapter 5 based onw90 10/1 15 ̊20)
Be careful not to appraise value of our works on the basis of outward appearance (Mt 6:1-6, 16-18;w90 10/1
15-17;w78 7/15 30-1;w78 9/1 14-15)
Motive is a key factor—not hypocritical, not seeking attention for self, but bringing honor to God
Jehovah sees what is in our hearts
KEEP  SEEKING  GOD’S  KINGDOM
Note to the speaker:
Cultivate deep appreciation for the counsel in the Sermon on the Mount in which Jesus showed how to seek the
Kingdom. We need to listen to these wise words and to exert ourselves to gain the Kingdom
No. 44-E9/07

Be  spiritually  minded,  putting  spiritual  interests  first,  not  getting  diverted  by  materialistic  pursuits  (Mt  6:
19-21;w90 10/1 18;w78 9/15 9;w89 7/15 13-14)
Proper to care for our material needs; but not proper to become a slave to them, letting them control our
life (Mt 6:24;w78 9/15 10)
Cultivate trust in God and in his promise to bless our efforts to obtain necessities of life (Mt 6:25-34;w90
10/1 18-19;w78 10/1 24-6)
WE NEED TO EXERT OURSELVES TO GAIN THE KINGDOM(9 min.)
To keep  out unworthy ones,  God requires that those entering the Kingdom travel cramped road,  find narrow
gate (Mt 7:13, 14;w90 10/1 23 ̊8, 9;w78 11/15 29-30)
Do not take view that it is impossible; forgiveness for unintentional sins is available (Mt 6:12-15)
What is required is that we truly love what is right (Mt 7:7, 8;w90 10/1 22 ̊6;w78 11/1 22)
This will move us to persistent effort, not giving up easily when problems arise
Must build our spiritual house on obedience to the teachings of Jesus Christ (Mt 7:24-27;w90 10/1 24 ̊13-15;w78
12/15 12-13)
Includes imitating Jesus in sharing the good news of the Kingdom with others (Mt 5:14-16;w90 10/1 24 ̊12;
w78 3/15 11)
This is a vital work; others need to hear; those who share in work reap rich rewards
There  is  a  grand  future  ahead;  blessings  of  God’s  new  world  are  the  answer  to  every  righteous  desire  of  our
hearts (Ps 145:13, 16)
Jehovah will provide these things because he wants us to have them (Mt 6:33)
He  will  bless  our  efforts  to  gain  them;  the  question  is:  Do  we  truly  want  not  only  the  blessings  of  God’s
Kingdom but also his righteousness?
We  need  to  keep  on  seeking  God’s  Kingdom  by  (1)  applying  ourselves  diligently  to  get  acquainted  with  Jeho-
vah, the Universal Sovereign, (2) cultivating love for his ways, (3) putting these into application in our lives,
and (4) advocating God’s Kingdom to others
